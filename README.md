# hyperpolarized-mri-toolbox

The goal of this toolbox is to provide research-level and prototyping software tools for hyperpolarized MRI experiments. It is currently based on MATLAB code, and includes code for designing radiofrequency (RF) pulses, readout gradients, data reconstruction, and data analysis.

It is hosted on this open-source, collaborative platform in order to encourage anyone and everyone in the hyperpolarized MRI research community to contribute tools that will help our field rapidly progress.

## MyBinder online demos

Look for notebooks under recon/EPI demo/ and kinetic_modeling/

## Hyperpolarized Metabolic MRI Seminar

For general education on hyperpolarzed cabron-13 metabolic MRI, lectures and slides from the UCSF Hyperpolarized MR Seminar (summer 2019) are available

## Additional Software Resources

This includes, as a subtree, the
[Spectral-Spatial-RF-Pulse-Design toolbox](https://github.com/LarsonLab/Spectral-Spatial-RF-Pulse-Design) for hyperpolarized MRI RF pulse design.

For enhanced data visualization tools, including optimized implementations of some data processing and reconstruction algorithms, see the Spectrscopic Imaging VIsualization and Computing (SIVIC) framework (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sivic/), which is also hosted on [github](https://github.com/SIVICLab/sivic)

## Support

This toolbox was created as a part of the UCSF Hyperpolarized MRI Technology Resource Center (http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/research/labs/hyperpolarized-mri-tech) which is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Grant P41-EB013598).
